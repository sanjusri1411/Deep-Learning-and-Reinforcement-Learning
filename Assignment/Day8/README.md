SimpleRNN, GRU, and LSTM differ in handling sequential information and memory. SimpleRNN is basic and fast but struggles with long sequences due to vanishing gradients, making it suitable for short sequences. GRU introduces gating mechanisms to capture longer dependencies with fewer parameters, offering a good speed-accuracy tradeoff.

LSTM is the most powerful for capturing long-term dependencies with its separate memory cell and three gates, yielding higher accuracy but at a higher computational cost. In practice, SimpleRNN is best for small data, GRU for moderate-length sequences, and LSTM for complex tasks requiring long-term context.
